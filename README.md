## MoonRover

#Description

MoonRover is a fun, single player, browser game. As you rove around the moon in search of resources, the goal is to collect as many as possible using the Up and Down arrow keys from your keyboard. Resources are represented with Icecubes. Craters must be avoided at all times, else the MoonRover will be trashed. However if the MoonRover does drive over 3 craters the the game is over.
